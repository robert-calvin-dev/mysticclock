    1: "You were born to lead, not follow. Your life path thrives in independence, originality, and ambition. There's a constant itch to initiate‚Äîprojects, ideas, movements. You‚Äôre often misunderstood as pushy, but that‚Äôs just passion with a sharp edge. Your soul signed up for self-reliance, meaning your biggest lesson is trusting your gut over the crowd‚Äôs consensus. Blaze trails, not bridges.",
    2: "Diplomacy is your divine gift. While others charge ahead, you weave behind the scenes, bringing people together with quiet grace. Your sensitivity is strength in disguise‚Äîit‚Äôs what makes you intuitive and deeply kind. This life is about collaboration, not control. You‚Äôre here to teach patience, peace, and the power of listening. Embrace your softness; it‚Äôs your sharpest tool.",
    3: "You were born to create, communicate, and captivate. Expression is your oxygen. Whether it‚Äôs through art, humor, or sheer charisma, you magnetize attention effortlessly. But with great wit comes great responsibility‚Äîdon‚Äôt waste your voice on shallow noise. You're a mood alchemist, turning trauma into poetry and pain into performance. Share boldly, but stay grounded in truth.",
    4: "Structure is sacred to you. You're the builder who finds freedom through form. Discipline, practicality, and loyalty run deep in your blueprint. You crave stability, and often you‚Äôre the only sane voice in chaotic rooms. But don‚Äôt let rigidity turn to stagnation. You‚Äôre here to show the world that responsibility is sexy when worn with pride and purpose.",
    5: "You incarnated to break rules. Freedom isn‚Äôt a luxury‚Äîit‚Äôs your lifeblood. You thrive in change, movement, and sensuality. Travel, variety, and risk are your textbooks. But too much stimulation can scatter you. You‚Äôre here to master chaos, not be consumed by it. Life‚Äôs a dance floor. Don‚Äôt just flail‚Äîlearn the rhythm that lets you lead the dance.",
    6: "Love is your ministry. You came here to serve, to nurture, to restore beauty and balance. Family, community, and justice weigh heavy on your shoulders, and rightly so‚Äîyou‚Äôre built for it. But remember: martyrdom isn‚Äôt nobility. Self-love is your first duty. You teach others how to heal by healing yourself without apology or delay.",
    7: "You‚Äôre not just curious‚Äîyou‚Äôre cosmic. Seeker of truth, analyzer of the unseen, you‚Äôve always felt the veil between worlds was a bit too thin. You question everything, and your soul demands solitude to process. This life is about depth, not speed. You‚Äôll be misunderstood until you stop needing to be understood. Mystery is your native tongue.",
    8: "You came to master power, not avoid it. Ambition pulses through your bones. You see systems, wealth, influence‚Äîand you‚Äôre not afraid to take the throne. But the test? Integrity. You‚Äôre here to prove power doesn‚Äôt have to corrupt. Build empires, but don‚Äôt forget your humanity. True wealth isn‚Äôt just measured in money‚Äîit‚Äôs legacy, too.",
    9: "Your soul has been here many times. You walk this life like a farewell tour‚Äîwise, sensitive, and burdened with the urge to save the world. Compassion defines you, but martyrdom haunts you. Learn to give without disappearing. You‚Äôre here to release, forgive, and transcend. You‚Äôre a sunset in human form‚Äîhaunting, healing, and never really gone.",
    11: "You vibrate higher. Life Path 11 isn‚Äôt for the faint-hearted. You carry a double dose of intensity‚Äîpart dreamer, part divine antenna. Visions come uninvited. Anxiety walks beside genius. Your challenge is to ground the lightning. Spiritual leadership is your birthright, but it starts with stabilizing yourself. You‚Äôre not crazy‚Äîyou‚Äôre calibrated for the future.",
    22: "You‚Äôre the master builder‚Äîpart mystic, part engineer. You dream in blueprints and execute with precision. Vision without execution is just fantasy, and you were born to manifest the impossible. But ego and fear are your shadows. Don‚Äôt shrink or explode‚Äîstand tall and build from purpose. The world changes when you decide it should.",
    33: "This is the rare path of the teacher-savior. You live in service to something greater. Compassion oozes from you. You feel others‚Äô pain like your own. You‚Äôre here to embody unconditional love in action, not just in sentiment. This life is no vacation‚Äîit‚Äôs a masterclass in healing, self-sacrifice, and grace. When you speak, the broken listen."

    1: "People see you as confident, capable, and driven. You have ‚Äúmain character energy‚Äù‚Äîeven when you try to dim it. First impressions scream independence. You‚Äôre quick to take charge, and others often look to you for direction. Be mindful not to overpower gentler energies. Your vibe says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this.‚Äù Make sure that‚Äôs the truth, not just the mask.",
    2: "You walk into a room and immediately soften it. Your presence is calm, non-threatening, and deeply intuitive. People trust you even before they know you. You‚Äôre a natural listener, often underestimated until your quiet insight hits like truth lightning. Underneath that peace is resilience. You‚Äôre not weak‚Äîyou just don‚Äôt waste energy proving strength.",
    3: "You sparkle. Personality 3 is vibrant, expressive, and contagiously fun. People feel better just being near you. You joke, charm, and storytell your way into hearts. But beware the tendency to perform. When your smile is real, it heals. You‚Äôre the party and the poet. Let them meet the whole you‚Äînot just the highlight reel.",
    4: "You look like someone who can be counted on‚Äîand you are. Stable, practical, and always prepared, you radiate competence. People hand you responsibility even when you didn‚Äôt ask for it. There‚Äôs a quiet strength to you. But rigidity can make you seem distant. It‚Äôs okay to be the rock. Just don‚Äôt forget you‚Äôre also human.",
    5: "You're unpredictable‚Äîand that‚Äôs why you're unforgettable. People sense excitement, risk, and maybe a little chaos when you enter. You bring spice to bland rooms and shake up sleepy conversations. But you might come off flaky or restless if you don‚Äôt anchor yourself. Your energy is addicting. Use it wisely. Stir, don‚Äôt shatter.",
    6: "People feel safe with you. You radiate warmth, comfort, and dependability. Friends often see you as a caretaker or emotional anchor. You lead with your heart, not your ego. But don‚Äôt let kindness become control. You're not here to fix everyone. You‚Äôre here to model love that includes boundaries.",
    7: "You give off mystery. People may be drawn to you but feel unsure how to reach you. You observe more than you speak, and your depth is apparent‚Äîeven intimidating. It‚Äôs not coldness; it‚Äôs caution. You don‚Äôt trust easily, but when you do, you‚Äôre profound company. Still waters run deep‚Äîand occasionally dangerous.",
    8: "You command attention. Your vibe is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mess with me,‚Äù even when you‚Äôre smiling. People assume you‚Äôre successful, driven, and possibly intimidating. Leadership suits you, but make sure it‚Äôs earned, not imposed. When you balance ambition with empathy, you become unstoppable. Power looks good on you‚Äîjust tailor it with kindness.",
    9: "You walk in with the weight of stories. People feel your empathy immediately. You seem like someone who‚Äôs been through things‚Äîand grown. You carry a gentle melancholy that draws others in. There‚Äôs something old about your presence, like a human lighthouse. Just make sure you aren‚Äôt always the safe harbor. You get to rest, too.",
    11: "You‚Äôre magnetic, almost otherworldly. People don‚Äôt just notice you‚Äîthey feel you. There‚Äôs something unspoken in your aura that makes others pause. Sensitivity shines in you like a spotlight. You‚Äôre read as intense, even psychic. But it can be overwhelming. Protect your energy. You‚Äôre here to light the way, not burn out trying.",
    22: "You give the impression of someone who gets things done. There‚Äôs a seriousness to your presence, a quiet pressure of potential. People sense you‚Äôre capable of big things‚Äîeven if you‚Äôre still figuring it out. You radiate vision and structure. Don‚Äôt play small to avoid scaring people. Show up as the architect you are.",
    33: "Your presence is pure heart. People instinctively open up to you, sensing they‚Äôll be met with love, not judgment. You appear nurturing, compassionate, and deeply wise. But you‚Äôre not here just to comfort‚Äîyou‚Äôre here to awaken. When you speak, people feel seen. Your vibe is healing. Don‚Äôt waste it in silence."

     overview: `<b>Core Personlity</b></br>
Capricorn is ambition with a backbone. You‚Äôre the architect of success, with eyes on the summit and ice in your veins. You build empires while others scroll. You don‚Äôt brag‚Äîyou own.

<br><br><b>Love & Romance</b><br>
You love like a fortress. Dry humor, old-school loyalty. You open up slowly but deeply. Affection is earned, not assumed. You‚Äôre sensual in private‚Äîbut serious in public.

<br><br><b>Career & Money</b><br>
You were probably born employed. Finance, politics, business, structure. You save more than you spend and plan while others panic.

<br><br><b>Shadown Side</b><br>
Workaholic. Emotionally walled off. Control freak. Vulnerability terrifies you‚Äîbut it's where your power is buried.

<br><br><b>Symbolism & Insight</b><br>
Saturn-ruled, cardinal earth. The Goat‚Äîclimbing mountains no one else can even see.

You want connection without control. Your partner has to be your friend and your freedom. You love with your mind first, heart second. Ghosting is an unfortunate tool in your kit.

<br><br><b>Career & Money</b><br>
Technology, science, activism, innovation. You disrupt. You invent. You‚Äôre allergic to cubicles. Money is just fuel for ideas.

<br><br><b>Shadown Side</b><br>
Detached. Contrarian. Emotionally unavailable. You feel more than you show‚Äîdon‚Äôt forget to show.

<br><br><b>Symbolism & Insight</b><br>

You‚Äôre a dream swimming in a harsh world. Pisces is empathy personified, psychic AF, and perpetually on the edge of fantasy and reality. You're not here to survive‚Äîyou‚Äôre here to feel.

<br><br><b>Love & Romance</b><br>
You love with your entire soul and lose yourself in the process. You want someone who sees your depths and doesn‚Äôt try to fix them. You love like a poem, cry like a movie, and forgive like it‚Äôs a superpower.

<br><br><b>Career & Money</b><br>
Creative fields, healing, music, mysticism‚Äîwherever the intangible becomes magic. Money feels gross to you‚Äîbut you attract it when you flow.

<br><br><b>Love & Romance</b><br>
You flirt like a flamethrower‚Äîquick, bold, a little reckless. You fall fast, and if they can‚Äôt keep up, you‚Äôre already halfway to the next conquest. Passion matters. Boredom is death.

<br><br><b>Career & Money</b><br>
You don‚Äôt do ‚Äúmiddle management.‚Äù You‚Äôre built to lead, build, break, and rebuild. You earn fast and spend faster‚Äîbut somehow, you land on your feet.
