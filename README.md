# 🔮 MysticClock — A Mood-Switching Video Clock Web App

**MysticClock** is a responsive, full-screen video clock that visually adapts to different user moods. Built for the browser and optimized for mobile and desktop, this project lets users toggle between moods—like calm, chaotic, or melancholic—and watch the background seamlessly shift with animated videos while the current time is always front and center.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

Sometimes a clock isn’t just a clock. This was a front-end coding challenge in aesthetic control, emotional UX, and mobile video behavior. I also wanted a lightweight, mood-enhancing screen you could leave on in the background—sort of like a moving art piece that also tells time.
